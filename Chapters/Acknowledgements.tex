This is a compilation of lectures I attended and books I read on the topic of Quantum Field Theory. I chose a structure where we go through the quantization process and philosophy from the Hamiltonian classical field theory to canonical quantization, discussing relevant topics, and then moving over to path integral quantization. Note that we distinctly distinguish between the vacuum QFT and non-equilibrium QFT with its corresponding reduction scheme following in later chapters.\\
